# freya-core

You probably want the current official Freya repositories and organization: https://github.com/freya-fs.

As of version 4.0, Freya will be moving under the Xyncro organization (see https://github.com/freya-fs/freya/issues/149 for more). As part of that, the project will move to a more granular repository structure to enable different elements of the stack to move at different paces and offer different guarantees around stability, etc. This repository is part of that shift, and will be used for work on alpha/beta versions of Freya 4.0 leading up to the 4.0 release.
